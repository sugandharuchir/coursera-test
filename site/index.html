<div id="content" class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><div id="tile">CHICKEN</div> thjetdhdv jjsdgsd jdsdyhbdhd dkffnd i just wanted to make a collapsable nav, but it did not work. What do I do now? I am caught up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do I need java script in order to make it clickable and show the drop down menu? Because it just does not get clicked when i try to click it and absolutely nothing gets displayed! And do I always need to go and check documentation for bootstrap components when I need to use them? Because I just can't remember all classes and ids i need to assign to the divs and spans. Something is not right? yes? I need to figure this out somehow. It always happens so. I get stuck somewhere and then it becaomes a dead end. It stalls all progress that I could ever make and then it's weeks and months before I can finally see what was actually wrong. Have I put text enough? Or do I need to babble more? I will check it out now, i suppose. It wa snot tall enough I guess. And now I am not even able to target this div for styling. What the hell is wrong? Where am I doing things wrong? I really do want to submit on time. But I am running freakingly late. It bothers me a lot. I should be able to target my div element swith the ids assigned to themm, yes?? But no! It is not working, somehow! What do I do now? htvzjxuzha  mixyxhjxxxxmx jdnnxhddhnx poiytr ewr jhytg jdy aloi ali ali xnsdddbndhxsn for hdjhdsk hdsukdhsakucnchsajke hjnjkiteb hsertyngliuy cgc hcgsscbnxcbd hdssnshchcnxkd kl;kdNCC DDDD fuxcjk jidd What do i do now oops  iam caught upnnnxnxx xsjchshckcjkc jjchsncsncsdlkcjsddc.
